                    <p>Aerosmith are possibly the definitive US rock'n'roll band still playing today. Their career statistics
                      are truly incredible, from the fact that they have sold over 100 million albums across the world to
                      the fact that they have won countless leading music awards. With their diehard fans, they are still
                      going strong after 30 years. Their sound still remains relevant and creatively strong, and many believe
                      that their accomplishments as a band have set the standard for both commercial and artistic achievement
                      within the music business. Certainly they have stood the test of time, but they have also defeated
                      their own demons, including brushes with substance abuse.</p>

                    <p>The band started in 1969, in New Hampshire, USA. Singer and drummer Steve Tyler checked out a local band
                      called The Jam Band, with Tom Hamilton and Joe Perry. Although he was currently in another band, Tyler
                      decided then that his future lay with this creative duo, citing their incredible energy and his classic
                      influences. Tyler's friend Joey Kramer was brought in on drums, followed by Brad Whitford on guitar,
                      and Aerosmith was born. Their first album - Aerosmith - was released in 1973, with Dream On as the
                      album's single release. The band toured widely, supporting other bands such as The Kinks. Their second
                      album was Get Your Wings in 1974, which spent 86 weeks in the charts. Their watershed release was Toys
                      In The Attic, a breakthrough that would sell millions. This was followed by Rocks in 1976 and the hits
                      came rapidly, including Walk This Way, Sweet Emotion and Last Child.</p>

                    <p>The band have played sell-out tours all around the world, including Europe, Japan, Australia, North America,
                      Israel and South America. They have toured the globe over 30 times. I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing was
                      their first No. 1 hit at the end of the nineties, and the band joined the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame
                      in 2001. At this point they had won over 55 top musical awards and were voted as MTV Icons.</p>

                    <p>Iron Maiden was formed in 1976 by bass player Steve Harris and it was four years before they released
                      their first, self-titled, album. Iron Maiden was a hit in the UK, largely thanks to the successful
                      single, Running Free. The band's second album, Killers, released in 1981, had a harder edge than their
                      first and was also a UK hit. Original vocalist, Paul Di'Anno, left the band in 1982 and was replaced
                      with Bruce Dickinson who completed what is now considered to be Iron Maiden's classic line-up. The
                      same year saw the release of the seminal rock album, Number of the Beast, which was the band's first
                      worldwide hit and featured such classic tracks as Hallowed Be Thy Name and the album's title track.
                      Iron Maiden took full advantage of their new found global fame and quickly put out their next album,
                      Piece of Mind, before going on two major tours.</p>

                    <p>Iron Maiden were on a roll and they released Powerslave, another huge album, in 1983. The band toured
                      Powerslave for 11 months which resulted in 1985's double live album, Live After Death. Their next two
                      releases were both concept albums, Somewhere in Time from 1986 and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh
                      Son. Seventh Son was widely considered to be the band's best album since Number of the Beast and spawned
                      the successful singles, The Evil That Men Do and The Clairvoyant.</p>

                    <p>After a relatively unsuccessful spell with Blaze Bayley as their singer, Iron Maiden welcomed Dickinson
                      back in 1999 and a new album, Brave New World, hit the charts in 2000. In 2005 they undertook a huge
                      tour as co-headliners with Black Sabbath and they have continued to tour and release new albums ever
                      since.</p>

                                <p>Since bursting on to the music scene as runner-up on the 2009 series of The X Factor, pop
                                  singer and songwriter Olly Murs has achieved an incredible level of success. Undeniably
                                  much loved in the UK and Ireland, Olly has undertaken several tours to showcase his talents.
                                  He began with The X Factor tour in early 2010, followed by a theatre tour in 2011 and has
                                  gone on to perform to huge audiences all over the world. Over 150,000 fans had the chance
                                  to see Olly at his 2013 UK and Ireland arena tour. Olly gained still more international
                                  recognition when he teamed up with One Direction, opening the show for them on the US leg
                                  of their very first international tour.</p>

                                <p>Born in Essex, Olly lived with his parents, sister and twin brother. Having played semi-professionally,
                                  a career in football seemed likely until an injury ended this dream. However, having unsuccessfully
                                  auditioned twice for The X Factor, it was third time lucky for Olly and he embarked on
                                  a life-changing journey. His performance of the Stevie Wonder hit, Superstition, would
                                  see him become runner-up in 2009. Olly began work on his debut album almost immediately.
                                  His debut single, Please Don t Let Me Go, shot straight to the top of the charts in September
                                  2010, and his second hit Thinking Of Me reached number four in November of the same year.
                                  His self-titled album hit the shops that same month, debuting at number two.</p>

                                <p>Aside from his hugely successful music career, Olly has also demonstrated a talent for television,
                                  presenting initially on the spin-off show The Xtra Factor before returning as a guest mentor
                                  in The X Factor in 2013. An ITV2 documentary, Life On Murs, followed him on his sell-out
                                  2012 tour and offered a unique insight into Olly’s world. A keen Manchester United fan,
                                  Olly is also a regular participant in various charity soccer events.</p>
